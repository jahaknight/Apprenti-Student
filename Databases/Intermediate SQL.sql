-- 6. Delete the "Computer Science" subject 
-- a) what error message?
-- b) why?

-- a) Attempt (this should FAIL while courses still reference the subject) 
-- Expected : Error Code: 1451 - Cannot delete or update a parent row:
-- 			  Foreign key constraint fails
DELETE FROM Subject
WHERE SubjectName = 'Computer Science';

-- b) Explanation for error
-- The subject row is a PARENT referenced by Course.SubjectID
-- MYSQL prevents deleting a parent row that still has CHILD rows 
-- Have to delete (or reassign) the child Course rows first

-- 7. Delete the "Java 101" course 
DELETE FROM Course
WHERE CourseName = 'Java 101'
	AND SubjectID = @cs_id;
    
-- verify
SELECT CourseID, CourseName
FROM Course
WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id
ORDER BY CourseName;

-- 8. Delete the remaining "Computer Science" courses
DELETE FROM Course
WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id;

-- verify
SELECT CourseID, CourseName
FROM Course 
WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id;

-- 9. Delete the "Computer Science" (now that children are gone)
DELETE FROM Subject 
WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id;

-- Final checks
SELECT * FROM Subject WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id;
SELECT * FROM Course WHERE SubjectID = @cs_id;
