//        monthlyPayment = (loanAmountÃ—(interestRate/100)/12)

//        1. Use Assignment Operators:
//             Increase loanAmount by $5,000 (+=).
        loanAmount += 5000;
//             Reduce the annualInterestRate by 1% (-=).

//
//         2. Use Comparison Operators:
//             Check if the loanAmount exceeds $30,000.
        boolean isLoanAmountOver30k = loanAmount > 30000;
//             Check if the monthlyPayment is more than $500.

//
//          3. Use Logical Operators:
//            Determine if the loan is affordable (monthly payment is below $500 AND
//                    term is over 3 years).
        boolean isAffordable = (updatedMonthlyPayment < 500.0) && (loanTermYears >3);
//            Determine if the loan is expensive (monthly payment is above $700 OR
//                    interest rate is over 6%).
        boolean isExpensive = (updatedMonthlyPayment > 700.0) || (annualInterestRate > 6.0);
//
//           4. Print all results.
